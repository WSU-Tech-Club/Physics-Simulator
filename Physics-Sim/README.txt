Coding Standard:
[insert coding rules here]

Documentation:
We are going to look at Doxygen for inline documentation. 
Please comment your code with appropriate descriptive words..

Source Control Rules:
If you are working on a specific feature, create a separate branch for it, and when that feature is completed
we will merge that branch back in.
In general, we dont want to always work on the master branch, it will clutter it up.
