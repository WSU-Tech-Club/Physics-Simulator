2) Class Names Capitalised.
3) Local variables start with a lower case letter.
4) All Classes for this project will be in the PhysicsSim namespace
5) No 'egyptian' brackets (where the open bracket is on the same line as the loop)
6) Avoid variable names like 'file', 'a', etc.

Documentation:
We are going to look at Doxygen for inline documentation.
Please comment your code with appropriate descriptive words..
function comment blocks should (for now) try and follow this format:

//Summary:

Source Control Rules:
1) If you are working on a specific feature, create a separate branch for it, and when that feature is completed
	we will merge that branch back in.
2) In general, we dont want to always work on the master branch, it will clutter it up.
3) Commit messages should be short, sweet, and to the point (max ~15 words)
4) Branches are your friends, dont be afraid of them
